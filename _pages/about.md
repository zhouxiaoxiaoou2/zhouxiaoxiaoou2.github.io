Postdoctoral-level researcher with a strong interdisciplinary background spanning optical instrumentation, thin-film devices, and real-time spectroscopy. Skilled in optical platform design and simulation, automated instrument control (Python/MATLAB), and advanced data analysis for material and device performance evaluation.

Experienced in developing customised laboratory instruments and prototyping MVP-level devices within innovative start-up environments. My work bridges physics, materials engineering, and applied product development, with a focus on translating fundamental research into practical technologies.

Current interests include photonic integrated circuits, optical system simulation, and sustainable energy applications, where I aim to apply my expertise to deliver scalable and impactful solutions.
